Question 01. What are the types of variables in JAVA? Explain with examples please.

Answer:
There are four types of variables in JAVA. 

a) Instance Variable: Variables which are declared outside the constructors, methods or blocks but within the class
	is known as Instance variables. Instance variables are instantiated when an object of that class is created.
	Instance variables are accessible to all constractors and methods within the class body. 
	Example:
		public class Bank{
			//Instance Variables
			private int bankID;
			private String bankName;
		}

b) Local Variable: The variables that are declared within the body of a method is called local variables. Other methods
	can not access these variables as other methods are not aware of the existence of a local variable declared within
	method block. It is better to instanciated a local variable before using it.
	Example:
		public class Bank{
			private int bankID;
			private String bankName;
			private int interestRate;

			public int getTotalAmmount(int amount){
				//Local variables
				int totalMonth = 36;
				return totalMonth*interestRate*amount;
			}

		}

c) Class Variable: A class variables is declared with the static modifier. Regardless of how many instances of that 
	class exists, a single copy of class variables is always exists. 
	Example:
		public class Bank{
			private int bankID;
			private String bankName;
			private int interestRate;
			//class variables
			private static String institutionType = "Bank";
			public int getTotalAmmount(int amount){
				//Local variables
				int totalMonth = 36;
				return totalMonth*interestRate*amount;
			}

		}


d) Parameters: Parameters act as variables inside the methods. The method can use the parameter for determining the
	final result or returning the result. Parameters are specified inside the parentheses. 
	public class Bank{
			private int bankID;
			private String bankName;
			private int interestRate;
			//class variables
			private static String institutionType = "Bank";
			//amount is the parameter here mentioned inside parentheses
			public int getTotalAmmount(int amount){
				//Local variables
				int totalMonth = 36;
				return totalMonth*interestRate*amount;
			}

		}

2. What is the benefits of a Static method in JAVA?

Answer:
	a) Static methods can be used without creating an object as it belongs to the class level.
	b) Static methods are initialized when class is loaded, and it is quick to call.
	c) Static methods are globally unique.
	d) Unique in memory and resides in memory after class is loaded.

3. What are the purposes of Constructor in JAVA?

Answer: 
	a) Using constructor, an object of a class is created.
	b) Constructor is used to define the object in initial state.
	c) Constructors let the user know about dependencies. User can identify of the requirements before using it.

4. Write a code in JAVA to compare three integer values and show which one is the largest number.

Answer:
	import java.util.*;
public class Question04 {
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//define scanner object
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		//read three values from the console and store them in separate variables
		System.out.println("Enter the first value: ");
		int firstValue = scanner.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Enter the Second value: ");
		int secondValue = scanner.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Enter the third value: ");
		int thirdValue = scanner.nextInt();
		
		//Implement the logic using if else 
		if(firstValue >= secondValue && firstValue >= thirdValue) System.out.println("Largest Value: "+firstValue);
		else if (firstValue <= secondValue && secondValue >= thirdValue) System.out.println("Largest Value: "+secondValue);
		else if (firstValue <= thirdValue && secondValue <= thirdValue) System.out.println("Largest Value: "+thirdValue);
		else System.out.println("Can't determine!");
	}
}
